# Framework Friction Log Archive

Resolved and closed friction log entries, moved here from `friction-log.md` during `/maintain` sessions. This keeps the active friction log lean while preserving history for pattern analysis.

**How entries get here:** When `/maintain` resolves a friction log entry, it moves the complete entry (including the `**Resolved:**` line) from the active log to this archive.

**Searching:** Use grep to search this archive when looking for historical patterns. The `/friction-log` skill searches here automatically before creating new entries.
