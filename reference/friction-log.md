# Framework Friction Log

Running log of learnings from framework development, domain project feedback, and maintenance observations. Each entry captures something worth remembering about the framework itself.

---

## How to Use This Log

**When to add entries:**
- When a domain project encounters friction with framework behavior
- When you notice a pattern across multiple projects
- When something works surprisingly well
- When something fails unexpectedly during framework maintenance

**Entry types:**
- `core` — Issues with framework foundations or skill logic
- `intent` — Gaps or improvements in the install/intent files
- `process` — How framework maintenance workflows function
- `documentation` — Clarity or gaps in framework docs (README, CONTRIBUTING)

**Severity includes positive:** Capture what works, not just what breaks.

## Entry Format

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — [Brief descriptive title]

**Type:** core | intent | process | documentation
**Severity:** positive | minor | major
**Blast radius:** all projects | project generation | maintainers
**Status:** pending | resolved | deferred | wont-fix

**Observation:**
[What happened or was noticed]

**Before:** [What the framework produced or did]
**After:** [What was expected or desired]

**Confirmed reason:**
[The human's explanation — their words, not a summary]

**Affected files:**
[Which core/ or install/ files would need to change]

**Proposed fix:**
[Specific enough for /maintain to act on]

**Notes:**
[Additional context, related entries, patterns noticed]
```

Not every entry needs all fields. The essentials are: Observation, Type, Severity, Blast radius, Status. Include what you have; don't force what you don't.

**When `/maintain` resolves an entry**, it updates the Status field:
```markdown
**Status:** resolved
**Resolved:** [DATE] — [brief description of what was changed and where]
```

### 2026-02-19 — Voice and values may need splitting; values as transparent ethics

**Type:** core
**Severity:** major
**Blast radius:** all projects
**Status:** pending

**Observation:**
Voice (tone, personality, style) and values (ethics, priorities, non-negotiables) are
conceptually different things bundled into one file (`voice-and-values.md`). Voice might
vary by context — the same NLA could use different tones for different platforms or
audiences (Substack vs. Twitter, creative partner vs. educator). Values should be stable
across all contexts — you don't have different ethics for different platforms.

This suggests three potential changes:

1. **Split voice and values** into separate files. Values are stable and universal;
   voice may be contextual. Different lifecycles, different reasons to edit.

2. **Support multiple voices.** Like output-spec, a single voice file works for simple
   NLAs. NLAs with contextual tone needs could have multiple voice files
   (voice-substack.md, voice-twitter.md) referenced by the relevant task doc.

3. **Values as a foundational NLA concept.** Traditional code has always embedded values
   (what gets prioritized, who gets served, what gets filtered), but they're hidden in
   logic — scoring functions, filter criteria, if/else branches. In an NLA, values are
   written in natural language: readable, debatable, and modifiable by anyone who can
   read. "We never sacrifice accuracy for engagement" is a values statement that
   traditional code expresses through opaque logic nobody can inspect. An NLA just
   says it. This transparency is a fundamental capability worth discussing in
   `nla-foundations.md`.

**Affected files:**
- `core/nla-foundations.md` — values transparency as a foundational concept
- `app/shared/voice-and-values.md` convention — splitting, multiple voices
- `core/skills/startup.md` — loading voice context
- `install/structure-intent.md` — file structure
- `install/CLAUDE-intent.md` — runtime identity
- `.claude/skills/create-app/SKILL.md` — conversation flow and generation

**Notes:**
This is a bigger design than output-spec conditionality. Deserves its own session with
fresh context. Captured here so the insights aren't lost.

## Patterns to Watch

*Recurring themes that may need deeper attention:*

1. **Two-hop reading** — The LLM reads a wrapper, then a framework file, then domain files. Watch for confusion or context loss in the chain.

2. **Path resolution** — Domain projects use `../nla-framework/` paths. Watch for breakage when projects are in unexpected locations.

3. **Intent file completeness** — As the framework evolves, intent files must stay in sync. Track gaps between what `/create-app` needs and what intent files provide.

4. **Language breadth** — Domain-specific language leaking into framework-general docs. The framework was built around a transformation NLA; watch for words that assume transformation, deterministic output, or a specific workflow when the context should be shape-neutral.
