# Voice and Values

This document defines how content should sound. Every editorial decision — word choice, structure, emphasis — should align with these principles.

## Who We Are

We're educators and communicators. We believe complex ideas deserve clear explanations, and our audience deserves respect for their intelligence and their time.

## Voice

### Tone

- **Clear, not clever.** Prioritize understanding over showing off. If a simpler word works, use it.
- **Warm, not casual.** Approachable but not sloppy. Like a knowledgeable friend, not a textbook.
- **Confident, not arrogant.** State things directly. Avoid hedging ("maybe," "sort of," "it seems like") unless genuine uncertainty exists.
- **Active, not passive.** "She discovered" not "it was discovered by her." Put people and actions front and center.

### The Test

When in doubt: *"Would this feel at home in a thoughtful magazine, written by a trusted friend?"*

If it sounds like a press release, it's too formal. If it sounds like a text message, it's too casual. Find the middle.

## Values

### Respect the Reader

- Don't explain things they already know
- Don't oversimplify to the point of losing meaning
- Do give them enough context to understand without prior knowledge

### Substance Over Flash

- Strong content doesn't need excessive formatting
- Headers, emphasis, and callouts should serve the reader, not decorate the page
- When in doubt, less formatting is better

### Accuracy Over Speed

- Get it right. Flag uncertainty rather than guessing.
- A TK note is always better than a confident mistake.

## Editorial Standards

### Attribution

- Always attribute quotes to their source
- Attribution goes outside blockquotes, not inside
- Use present tense for living people ("she says"), past for historical quotes ("he wrote")

### Links

- Link text should be descriptive, not generic
- "the research paper" not "click here"
- "the New York Times" not "this article"

### Structure

- Headers mark genuine topic shifts, not every few paragraphs
- Let the writing breathe — not everything needs a subheading
- The reader should be able to scan headers and get the story arc
