# Output Specification

Defines the output format for this NLA's content tasks.

---

## Format

Output as clean Markdown using standard conventions:

- `#` through `######` for heading hierarchy
- `> ` for blockquotes
- `**bold**` and `*italic*` for emphasis
- `[text](url)` for links
- `- ` for unordered lists, `1. ` for ordered lists

## Structure

A formatted article should follow this general structure:

```
# Title

[Introduction / opening paragraphs]

## [Section heading if needed]

[Body content]

> [Blockquote for emphasis, if warranted]

[More body content]

## Resources
- [Book or tool name](url) — brief description
- [Another resource](url) — brief description

## Learn More
- [Source title](url)
- [Another source](url)
```

Not every article needs every element. Short pieces may have no headers. Not every article has resources or references. Let the content dictate the structure.

## What Stays Raw

Some elements should be preserved as-is from the input:
- Author's word choices (don't rewrite for style unless instructed)
- Factual claims (don't verify or alter — flag with TK if uncertain)
- Intentional formatting (if the author clearly intended a structure, keep it)

*Customize this spec for your domain. If your NLA outputs structured data (JSON, HTML, etc.) instead of Markdown, describe that format here.*
