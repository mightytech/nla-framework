# Feedback Log Archive

Resolved feedback log entries, moved here from `feedback-log.md` during `/maintain` sessions. This keeps the active feedback log lean while preserving history for pattern analysis.

**How entries get here:** When `/maintain` resolves a feedback log entry, it moves the complete entry (including the `**Resolved:**` line) from the active log to this archive.

**Searching:** Use grep to search this archive when looking for historical patterns.
