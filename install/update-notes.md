# Update Notes

What's changed in the framework and what it means for your project. Written for both
human readers scanning a changelog and the AI running `/update` as context for proposals.

Not every framework change gets a note — only changes where the *so what for your
project* isn't obvious from the intent diff alone.

For older notes, check `update-notes-archive.md`.

### 2026-02-19 — Cardinal Rule broadened, NLA Shapes added, TK references removed

**Commit:** 25e9c00
**Affects:** core/nla-foundations.md, install/CLAUDE-intent.md, install/skills-intent.md

The Cardinal Rule changed from "the human must always be able to compare changes
against the original and easily revert" to "the human decides." The old framing was
transformation-specific — it assumed an original to compare against. The new framing
is universal across stateless, persistent, and creative NLAs.

Projects with custom Cardinal Rule language in their CLAUDE.md: check whether your
framing is already aligned with the broader principle. If so, no change needed.

NLA Shapes (stateless, persistent, tool-using) was added to nla-foundations.md. This
is loaded by all projects automatically via `../nla-framework/`. Consider whether your
overview.md reflects which shape your NLA is.

A new Principle 6 (Configuration Is Natural Language) was added to nla-foundations.md.
Also loaded automatically. No project changes needed, but it may inform how projects
think about their config-spec.

TK note references were removed throughout — "flag uncertainty" replaces "use TK notes."
Projects using TK conventions in their own docs can keep them (they're domain choices),
but framework-generated references now use the general language. The domain skill
pattern in skills-intent.md has updated guardrails.
